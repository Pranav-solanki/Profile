          <p>
            Hello! I'm <strong>Your Name</strong>, a passionate frontend
            developer who loves turning ideas into interactive web experiences.
            I discovered my love for coding while building small projects and
            quickly became obsessed with the creativity and logic involved in
            web development.

        <div className="part">
          <p>
            My journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and since then
            Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into frameworks like React. I enjoy building
            clean, responsive interfaces and constantly learning new tools and
            best practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy photography and gaming, and I believe
            that creativity outside the screen fuels my work on it. I'm
            currently looking for opportunities where I can grow as a developer
            and work on real-world projects that make an impact.
