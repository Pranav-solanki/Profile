            Hello! I'm <span className="highlight">Your Name</span>, a passionate
            frontend developer who loves turning ideas into interactive web
            experiences. I discovered my love for coding while building small
            projects and quickly became obsessed with the creativity and logic
            involved in web development.

            My journey started with{" "}
            <span className="highlight">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>, and
            since then Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into frameworks like{" "}
            <span className="highlight">React</span>. I enjoy building clean,
            responsive interfaces and constantly learning new tools and best
            practices.

            Outside of coding, I enjoy{" "}
            <span className="highlight">photography and gaming</span>, and I
            believe that creativity outside the screen fuels my work on it. I'm
            currently looking for opportunities where I can grow as a developer
            and work on real-world projects that make an impact.
